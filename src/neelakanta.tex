\section{Angular Displacement and Velocity}
\subsection{Angular Displacement}
Just as displacement is defined as the change in position of an object, angular displacement is defined as
the angle swept by an object travelling in a circular path.\\\\
Let's look at an example. Say, an object travels from point $A$ to point $B$. In this process, say it 
covers an angle of $\theta$ (See figure \ref{fig.4}).
\mkfig{h!}{4}{2}{presentation.4.png}{An example} \\
Here, arc \(\overarc{$AB$}\) is the tangential displacement and $\theta$ is the angular displacement.
In this case, $$\text{\(\overarc{$AB$}\)}=r\theta,$$ where $r$ is the radius of the circular path.
Hence, the relationship between angular displacement and tangential displacement is: $$s=r\theta,$$
where $s$ is the tangential displacement and $\theta$ is the angular displacement.

\subsection{Angular Velocity} \label{sec.24}
Just as tangential velocity is displacement per unit time, angular velocity is the angle swept per unit time.
So, the average angular velocity can be written as: $$\omega_{avg}=\frac{\Delta \theta}{\Delta t},$$
where $\omega$ is the angular velocity, $\theta$ the angle swept and $t$ the time taken. \\\\
Now, as the change in time approaches 0, $\frac{\Delta \omega}{\Delta t}$ will become the instantaneous angular
velocity. Angular velocity as change in time approaches 0(instantaneous angular velocity) can be 
represented as: $$\omega=\frac{d\theta}{dt}.$$ Note that the $d$ before $\theta$ and $t$ is just a way to
represent the angular velocity as the change in time approaches 0. In general, $d$ is put before a variable to 
represent extremely small quantities.\\\\
The relationship between angular velocity and tangential velocity is: $$v=r\omega,$$
where $\omega$ is the angular velocity, $v$ is the tangential velocity and $r$ is the radius of the circular path.
We can also write the relationship as: $$\omega=\frac{v}{r}.$$

\section{Centripetal Force}
Centripetal force is the force that acts on a body travelling in a circular path, towards the center of the 
circle. The numerical value of centripetal force is given by: $$F_c=\frac{mv^2}{r},$$
where $F_c$ is the centripetal force, $m$ is the mass of the body, $r$ is the radius of the path and $v$ is the 
tangential velocity of the body.\\\\
Now, let's say that a person is twirling a ball of mass $m$ attached to a light and inextensible string of length
$r$.
Let us draw all the actual forces acting on it(ignore gravity).
\mkfig{h!}{5}{2}{presentation.5.png}{Forces acting on mass} \\\\
The only apparent force that is present is the tension due to the string $(T)$(See figure \ref{fig.5}).
But, we know that there is a centripetal force acting on any body going around in a circular path.
So, we can conclude that in this case, the tension due to the string is the cause of the centripetal force.
Hence, $T=F_c$.\\\\
From this, we can generically conclude that the net external force acting on a body travelling in a circular 
path, towards the center of the circular path is equal to the centripetal force. \\\\
Now, let us apply this to something different: Gravity.

\section{Orbital Velocity} \label{sec.2}
Let's start with a few problems.
  \begin{tcolorbox}
    \example{A person is twirling a ball of mass $m$ attached to a light, inextensible string of 
    length $r$ in space. Given that the tension in the string is $T$ N, find the tangential velocity.}
  \end{tcolorbox}
    \proof{
    We have already seen that the net external force acting towards the center of the circular path is equal to
    the centripetal force. Hence, in this case: $$F_c=\frac{mv^2}{r}=T.$$
  Hence, $$v=\sqrt{\frac{Tr}{m}}$$}
    \begin{tcolorbox}
      \example{A satellite of mass $m$ is revolving at a distance of $r$ from the center of a planet
      of mass $M$. Find the satellite's tangential velocity.}
    \end{tcolorbox}
    \proof{
    This problem is just like the previous one. The only difference is that instead of tension, there is a force
    of Gravity acting on the satellite. Hence, $$F_c=\frac{mv^2}{r}=\frac{GMm}{r^2}.$$
  So, $$v=\sqrt{\frac{GM}{r}}.$$}
If you could do the second problem on your own, you have figured out what this section is all about!\\

\section{Summary}
\begin{itemize}
  \item The relationship between angular velocity and tangential velocity is given by: 
    $$\omega=\frac{v}{r},$$ where $\omega$ is the angular velocity, $v$ the tangential velocity and $r$ the
    radius of the circular path.
  \item Centripetal Force is given by: $$F_c=\frac{mv^2}{r},$$ where $F_c$ is the centripetal force, 
    $m$ the mass of the object and $v$ the tangential velocity.
  \item The Orbital velocity of a satellite of mass $m$at a distance $r$ from the center of a planet of mass
    $M$ is given by: $$v_{\text{orbital}}=\sqrt{\frac{GM}{r}}.$$

Johannes Kepler was a 16th century astronomer who established three laws which govern the motion 
    of planets (around the sun). These are known as Kepler’s law of planetary motion. The same laws also 
    describe the motion of satellites (like the moon) around plants (like the earth).
\section{Kepler's First Law}
\subsection{Law Statement}
Kepler's first law states that all planets go around the Sun in an elliptical orbit, and that the Sun is 
at one of the foci of the orbit.\\\\
But, to understand this, we must first understand what an ellipse is.
\subsection{Definition of Ellipse}
Let us first plot two points on a graph, and call it $F_1$ and $F_2$. Now, find a point which is say, 
a distance $r_1$ away from $F_1$, and a distance of $r_2$ away from $F_2$. Can you also find another point that
is a distance $s_1$ away from $F_1$ and $s_2$ away from $F_2$, where $$r_1+r_2=s_1+s_2?$$
Now, if you plot infinite points such that $$r_1+r_2=s_1+s_2=p_1+p_2\cdots,$$ where $r_1, s_1, p_1, \dots$ are the
distances of the points from $F_1$ and $r_2,s_2,p_2,\dots$ are the distances from $F_2$, what will you get? 
For the answer, see figure \ref{fig.8.b}.
\begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering
  \mksubfig{t}{8.a}{0.3}{presentation.1.png}{An ellipse on the Cartesian plane}
  \mksubfig{t}{8.b}{0.3}{presentation.8.png}{An ellipse as a conic section}
  \caption{An ellipse}
  \label{fig.8}
\end{figure}
You will get an ellipse! So, An ellipse is a plane curve surrounding two focal points, such that 
for all points on the curve the sum of the distances to the focal points is constant, 
just like how all the points in a circle is equidistant from its center.\\\\
In fact both circle and ellipse are conic sections that is a curve obtained from the intersection of a 
cone and a plane, along with parabola and hyperbola (See figure \ref{fig.8.a}). \\\\
Now, it's easier to understand what Kepler's first law means. There is a proof for Kepler's first law, but
we are not going to prove it here.\\\\
In fact, Kepler didn't prove this law either. He concluded that planets revolve around the Sun in elliptical 
orbits based on observations. It was Newton who later proved Kepler's laws using his laws of gravitation.\\\\
Let's move on to the second law.

\section{Kepler's Second Law}
\subsection{Law Statement}
Kepler's second law states that a planet moving around the sun sweeps across equal areas in equal amounts of time.
\mkfig{h!}{2}{2}{presentation.2.png}{Kepler's second law} \\

\subsection{A Relation Between Distance from Planet and Velocity}\label{sec.1}
Let's examine this closely. Just like velocity is defined as the displacement per unit time, we can define 
areal velocity as the area swept per unit time. We know that $$v_{\text{avg}}=\frac{\Delta s}{\Delta t},$$
where $\Delta s$ is the change in displacement and $\Delta t$ is the change in time. \\\\
So, we can say: 
\begin{align} \label{eq.1}
  \text{Areal velocity}_\text{avg} = \frac{\Delta A}{\Delta t},
\end{align}
where $A$ is the area.
What happens when $\Delta t$ approaches $0$? As $\Delta t$ approaches 0, the right hand side of equation \ref{eq.1}
becomes the instantaneous areal velocity instead of the average areal velocity. \\\\
So, another way to represent equation \ref{eq.1} when $\Delta t$ approaches 0, is: 
\begin{align} \label{eq.2}
  v_A=\frac{dA}{dt},
\end{align}
where $v_A$ is the instantaneous areal velocity. Now, there is no need to get scared of this. It is just a way
to represent the areal velocity as the change in time approaches 0. \\\\
Now, let us take a small portion of the ellipse, where the angle made by the line segments($l_1,l_2$) 
which extend till the periphery of the ellipse (see figure \ref{fig.3})is $d\theta$ (Note that the $d$ before the
$\theta$ represents the fact that $d\theta$ is very small). \\
\mkfig{h!}{3}{2}{presentation.3.png}{Section of ellipse} \\
Since the angle is very small, the length of the $l_1,l_2$ are equal. Hence, we can treat the section of the 
ellipse as the section of a circle with center $F_1$ and radius $r$, where 
$$r=\text{ length of }l_1=\text{ length of }l_2.$$
Now, what is the area of this section? Well, it is simply the area of the section of a circle with radius
$r$ making an angle of $d\theta$. \\
\\
In general, how do we find the area of a section of a circle given that the radius is say, $s$, and the 
angle it makes at the center is say, $\alpha^{\circ}$? \\\\
The area will be: $$(\pi s^2)\times \frac{\alpha}{360}.$$
But, now let us say that the angle is $\beta$ radians. Radians is the SI unit for angles. $2\pi$ radians is 
equal to $360^{\circ}.$ Hence, if the angle is $\beta$ in radians, the area will be: 
$$\frac{\beta}{2\pi}\pi s^2.$$
\\
We can apply this to the section of our ellipse, which we are treating as a section of a circle too. 
We know that the radius is $r$, and angle $d\theta$. So, the area($dA$) of the section can be written as:
\begin{align}\label{eq.3}
  dA=\frac{d\theta}{2\pi}\pi r^2=r^2\frac{d\theta}{2}.
\end{align}
\\
Plugging this into equation \ref{eq.2}, we get: 
$$v_A=\frac{r^2\frac{d\theta}{2}}{dt}=\frac{r^2}{2}\frac{d\theta}{dt}.$$
Since we know that $\omega=\frac{d\theta}{dt}$, (Refer to section \ref{sec.24}) we can rewrite the above as: 
$$v_A=\omega\frac{r^2}{2}.$$
Since we know that $\omega=\frac{v}{r}$, we can rewrite the equation as:
$$v_A=\frac{r^2}{2}\frac{v}{r}=\frac{vr}{2}.$$
Since $v_A$ is constant, we can write:
\begin{align*}
  &\frac{vr}{2}=k\\
  \Rightarrow &\boxed{vr=2k=c},
\end{align*}
where $k$ and $c$ are constants, and $c=2k.$
Hence, $v$ is inversely proportional to $r$, where $r$ is the distance between the planet and the Sun.

\section{Kepler's Third Law} \label{sec.12}
\subsection{Law Statement}
Kepler's third law states that the cube of the major axis of the orbit of a planet around the sun is directly 
proportional to the square of time it takes to move around the sun. The law can be expressed as: 
\begin{align*}
  &T^2\propto a^3\\
  \Rightarrow &T^2 = k\cdot a^3,
\end{align*}
Where $a =$ major axis of the planet's orbit around the sun, $T =$ time period of the planet (around the sun)
and $k$ is a constant.\\
\subsection{A Little More About Ellipses}
Now, what is the major axis? It is the distance between the center of an ellipse and farthest point from the 
center of the ellipse(See figure \ref{fig.6}).
\mkfig{h!}{6}{2}{presentation.6.png}{Major axis of ellipse} \\
In figure \ref{fig.6}, $a=\overline{OD}$ is the major axis. \\

\subsection{Derivation for Circular Orbits}
Let's now try to derive the law(for circular orbits only).
First, what is time period mathematically, for circular orbits? Time period is the time an object takes to 
complete a full circle. In other words, it is the time takes for the object to travel a 
distance of $2\pi r$ units(Circumference of a circle).\\\\
Now, consider a planet travelling at a tangential velocity $v$ in a circular path with radius $r$ around the Sun. 
The time period will be the time taken to travel a distance of $2\pi r$. Hence, we can say: 
\begin{align}\label{eq.4}
T=\frac{2\pi r}{v}.
\end{align}
Since we know that the tangential velocity of an object in orbit at a distance $R$ from the center of a planet 
of mass $M$ is 
given by $$v_{\text{tangential}}=\sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}},$$
we can substitute $$v=\sqrt{\frac{GM}{r}},$$
where $M$ is the mass of the Sun, into equation \ref{eq.4}. Doing so, we get: 
\begin{equation} \label{eq.5}
  \begin{split}
    T &= \frac{2\pi r}{\sqrt{\frac{GM}{r}}} \\
    &= \frac{2\pi r\sqrt{r}}{\sqrt{GM}}\\
    &= 2\pi\sqrt{\frac{r^3}{GM}}.
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
Now, squaring both sides of equation \ref{eq.5}, we get: $$T^2=4\pi^2\frac{r^3}{GM}=\frac{4\pi^2}{GM}r^3.$$
Since $\frac{4\pi^2}{GM}$ is a constant, we let $k=\frac{4\pi^2}{GM}$. Hence, 
$$T^2=kr^3,$$ or $$\boxed{T^2\propto r^3}.$$

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Solutions to Problems Based on Chapter 1}
\begin{solution} \normalfont
We have already seen that $$v_{\text{orbital}}=\sqrt{\frac{GM}{r}},$$ where 
$v_{\text{orbital}}$ is the tangential velocity of orbital of a satellite around a planet, $M$ the mass of the 
planet and $r$ the radius of the orbit (Refer to section \ref{sec.2}). \\\\
Directly applying this to the problem, we get $$\boxed{v=\sqrt{\frac{GM}{r}}}.$$\\
\end{solution}
\begin{solution} \label{sol.1}\normalfont
The time period of an object going in a circular path with a tangential velocity say $v$
is given by: $$T=\frac{2\pi r}{v},$$ where $T$ is the time period, and $r$ the radius of the circular path.(Time
period is distance covered divided by velocity, and the distance in a circular path is $2\pi r$).\\\\
Now, let's come back to the problem.\\\\ 
Let $v$ be the tangential velocity and $r$ be the distance between the 
satellite and the center of the Earth.\\\\
\paragraph*{Part (a)} 
The tangential velocity will be: 
\begin{align}\label{eq.7}
  {v=\sqrt{\frac{GM}{r}}}.
\end{align}
Applying the formula for time period, we get: 
\begin{equation}\label{eq.8}
  \begin{split}
    &T=\frac{2\pi r}{v}\\
    \Rightarrow & r=\frac{Tv}{2\pi}
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
Substituting $v=\sqrt{\frac{GM}{r}}$ from equation \ref{eq.7} into equation \ref{eq.8}, we get: 
\begin{equation}\label{eq.9}
\begin{split}
  &r=\frac{T\sqrt{\frac{GM}{r}}}{2\pi}\\
  \Rightarrow &r\sqrt{r}=\sqrt{r^3}={T\frac{\sqrt{GM}}{2\pi}}\\
  \Rightarrow & r=\sqrt[3]{\frac{T^2GM}{4\pi^2}}\\
  \Rightarrow & r-R=\text{height from surface}=\boxed{\sqrt[3]{\frac{T^2GM}{4\pi^2}}-R}.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
\\
\paragraph*{Part (b)} 
Substituting the result we got for $r$ in equation \ref{eq.9}, into equation \ref{eq.7}, we get:
$$v={\sqrt{\frac{GM}{\sqrt[3]{\frac{T^2GM}{4\pi^2}}}}}=\boxed{\sqrt[3]{\frac{2\pi GM}{T}}}.$$
\end{solution}
\begin{solution} \normalfont
  We know that 
  \begin{align} \label{eq.10}
    T=\frac{2\pi R}{v},
  \end{align} where $v$ is the velocity of an object on the surface of the Earth.
  Dividing both sides of equation \ref{eq.10} by $T$ and multiplying both sides of it by $v$, we get:
  $$v=\boxed{\frac{2\pi R}{T}}.$$
\end{solution}

\subsection{Solutions to Problems Based on Chapter 2}

    We have seen that the areal velocity of a satellite in an elliptical orbit is:
    $$v_A=\frac{vr}{2},$$where $v_A$ is the areal velocity, $v$ the tangential velocity at a point and $r$ the
    distance between the point and the planet(Refer to section \ref{sec.1}).\\\\
    Letting areal velocity be $v_A$ and applying the concept to this problem, we get: 
    \begin{align} \label{eq.6}
      v_A=\frac{v(t)r(t)}{2}
    \end{align}
    But, what is $v_A$? How do we find it?\\\\
    Since $v_A$ is constant by Kepler's third law, $v_A$ at $t=0$ will be the same as the $v_A$ in equation 
    \ref{eq.6}.
    We can easily find both $v(0)$ and $r(0)$. So, we can simply substitute $t=0$ in equation \ref{eq.6} to 
    find the areal velocity. \\\\
    Substituting $t=0$ in the function $v(t)$, we get: $$v(0)=0^2+23\times 0 +2 = 2.$$
    We are also given that the distance between point $A$ and the planet is $x$(Refer to figure \ref{fig.7}) and 
    that $t=0$ at point $A$. So, $r(0)=x.$ Hence, $$v_A=\frac{2x}{2}=x.$$\\
    Substituting $v_A=x$ in equation \ref{eq.6}, we get: 
    \begin{align*}
      &x=\frac{v(t)r(t)}{2}\\
      \Rightarrow &v(t)r(t)=2x\\
      \Rightarrow &r(t)=\frac{2x}{v(t)}=\boxed{\frac{2x}{t^2+23t+2}}.
    \end{align*}
  \end{solution}
  \begin{solution} \label{sol.2}\normalfont
    Using Kepler's third law, we can say that (Refer to section \ref{sec.12}): $$T_1^2 \propto r_1^3,$$
    or 
    \begin{equation}\label{eq.11}
      \begin{split}
        &T_1^2=kr_1^3\\
        \Rightarrow &k=\frac{T_1^2}{r_1^3},
      \end{split}
    \end{equation} 
    where $k$ is a constant.\\\\
    Now, we let the time period of the other satellite be $T_2$. Hence, we can say that: $$T_2^2\propto r_2^3,$$
    or
    \begin{align} \label{eq.12}
      T_{2}^{2}=kr_2^3
    \end{align}
    Substituting $k$ from equation \ref{eq.11} into equation \ref{eq.12}, we get: 
    $$T_2^2=\frac{T_1^2}{r_1^3}\cdot r_2^3.$$
    Taking the square root on both sides, we get: $$T_2=\boxed{T_1\sqrt{\left(\frac{r_2}{r_1}\right)^3}}.$$
  \end{solution}
  \begin{solution} \normalfont
    Let $r_2$ be the distance from the center of the Earth that the satellite revolves.\\\\
    So, we know that:
    \begin{equation} \label{eq.13}
      \begin{split}
        &T_1^2=kr_1^3\\
        \Rightarrow & k=\frac{T_1^2}{r_1^3},
      \end{split}
    \end{equation}
    where $k$ is a constant.\\\\
    You might be tempted to do the same as in solution \ref{sol.2}, but we haven't found the time period of the
    second satellite, since we are only given the time period of the second satellite with respect to the Earth and
    not the time period of the satellite with respect to space. So, we need to find it's time period with respect to
    space.\\\\
    Since we are given that the satellite revolves in the same direction as the Earth's rotation, we can simply 
    add the time period of the Earth and the time period of the satellite with respect to the Earth to get the 
    satellite's time period with respect to space. Hence, $$T_2'=T+T_2,$$ where $T_2'$ is the actual time period
    of the satellite.\\\\
    Hence, by Kepler's third law, 
    \begin{equation} \label{eq.14}
      \begin{split}
        &T_2'^2=kr_2^3\\
        \Rightarrow & r_2=\sqrt[3]{\frac{T_2'^2}{k}}.
      \end{split}
    \end{equation}
    Now, substituting what we got for $k$ in equation \ref{eq.13} into equation \ref{eq.14}, we get:
    \begin{align} \label{eq.15}
      r_2=r_1\sqrt[3]{\frac{T_2'^2}{T_1^2}}.
    \end{align}
    Substituting $T_2'=T+T_2$, and into equation \ref{eq.15}, we get:
    \begin{align} \label{eq.16}
      r_2=r_1\sqrt[3]{\left(\frac{T+T_2}{T_1}\right)^2}.
    \end{align}
    Since we took $r_2$ as distance from center of the Earth, $r_2=R+h$, where $h$ is the height from the surface
    of the Earth.\\\\
    Substituting $r_2=R+h$ into equation \ref{eq.16}, we get:
    \begin{align*}
      & R+h=r_1\sqrt[3]{\left(\frac{T+T_2}{T_1}\right)^2}\\
      \Rightarrow & h=\boxed{r_1\sqrt[3]{\left(\frac{T+T_2}{T_1}\right)^2}-R}.
    \end{align*}
  \end{solution}
